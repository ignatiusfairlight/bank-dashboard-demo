A responsive web application that mimics the user interface of modern personal banking websites. Built with SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS, the dashboard includes core UI components such as account overviews, transaction summaries, and intuitive navigation.

The project is designed to refine front-end development and UI/UX skills by replicating real-world banking layouts and interactions. Planned enhancements include dark mode, interactive charts, and mock financial data to simulate a complete user experience.

This project highlights attention to responsive design, clean component architecture, and modern front-end practices.
